Incorporeal 2
=============

Let's try this again. Forge this time.

This is my first Forge 1.16 mod, it's been so long since I used Forge, go easy on me :)

# list of the old incorporeal features, for myself, cuz i forgot what the mod even added

## Things to port, in rough order of importance

* block and item models
* cygnus network
* ender soul core
* item frame tinkerer (there was some interest in botania taking this on)
* ticket conjurer
* rod of the fractured space
* corporea soul core (security system)
* natural redstone circuitry from redstone root plants
* corporea retainer evaporator (possssibly obsolete???)
* unstable cube
* funny despacito flower

## Things that have been ported

* corporea solidifier
* corporea ticket
* sanvocalia flower
* red string liar

## Things that will probably not be ported

* corporea decorative blocks
  * subsumed
* corporea spark tinkerer
  * obsoleted by paintslinger lens
* that block that obstructs corporea sparks from connecting
  * it's fairly computationally expensive and doesn't even work too well; just use paintslinger now
* lokiw block
  * wait it wasn't funny? never has been.
