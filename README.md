Incorporeal 2
=============

Let's try this again. Forge this time.

This is my first Forge 1.16 mod, it's been so long since I used Forge, go easy on me :)

# list of the old incorporeal features, for myself, cuz i forgot what the mod even added

## Things to port, in rough order of importance

* ticket conjurer
* rod of the fractured space
* potion soul core
* recipes Lol
* natural redstone circuitry from redstone root plants
* corporea retainer evaporator (possssibly obsolete???)
* unstable cube

## Things that have been ported

* corporea solidifier
* corporea ticket
* sanvocalia flower
* red string liar
* funny despacito flower
* item frame tinkerer (there was some interest in botania taking this on)
* ender soul core
* corporea soul core (security system)

## Things that will not be ported

* cygnus network
  * planning to replace with the rhododendrite tree
* corporea decorative blocks
  * subsumed
* corporea spark tinkerer
  * obsoleted by paintslinger lens
* that block that obstructs corporea sparks from connecting
  * it's fairly computationally expensive, and doesn't even work too well; just use paintslinger now
* lokiw block
  * wait it wasn't funny? Never has been
* forgotten shrine
  * weird fluff, only existed because the tile was left unused in botania and i found it interesting. it was deleted last year

## other things to do

move more things to datagen, i really dont like forge datagens though
