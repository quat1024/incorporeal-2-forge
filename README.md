Incorporeal 2 + Rhododendrite
=============================

Let's try this again. Forge this time. This is my first Forge 1.16 mod, it's been so long since I used Forge, go easy on me :)

This .jar contains two mods for the price of one: Incorporeal 2, a fairly straightforward port of Incorporeal less the "cygnus network", and Rhododendrite, that mechanic's successor. The reason for them being two separate mods is mainly for organizational purposes. Eventually I want to separate the mods into their own .jars. The reason I haven't is because Rhododendrite will not be very useful without Botania/a corporea network behind it.

# list of the old incorporeal features, for myself, cuz i forgot what the mod even added

## Things to port, in rough order of importance

* potion soul core
* recipes Lol
* natural redstone circuitry from redstone root plants
* frame screw

## Things that have been ported

* corporea solidifier
* corporea ticket
* sanvocalia flower
* red string liar
* funny despacito flower
* item frame tinkerer (there was some interest in botania taking this on)
* ender soul core
* corporea soul core (security system)
* ticket conjurer
* rod of the fractured space
* corporea retainer evaporator (possssibly obsolete???)
* unstable cube

## Things that will not be ported

* cygnus network
  * planning to replace with the rhododendrite mod
* corporea decorative blocks
  * subsumed
* corporea spark tinkerer
  * obsoleted by paintslinger lens
* that block that obstructs corporea sparks from connecting
  * it's fairly computationally expensive, and doesn't even work too well; just use paintslinger now
* lokiw block
  * wait it wasn't funny? Never has been
* forgotten shrine
  * weird fluff, only existed because the tile was left unused in botania and i found it interesting. it was deleted last year

## other things to do

# rhododendrite textures i have to do
